/*
code explaination:
if (n == 0)
  return 1;
  
Special Case for 0:
If the user inputs 0, the code immediately checks for it with if (n == 0).
Since 0 is a special case with exactly one digit, the code returns 1 and exits the program.
This prevents any further computation as 0 divided by 10 repeatedly would stay 0, leading to an infinite loop.

while (n != 0) {
        n = n / 10;
        ++count;
    }

    The while (n != 0) loop runs as long as n is not 0.
Inside the loop:
n = n / 10; divides n by 10 in each iteration. This effectively removes the last digit from n. For example:
If n = 1234, after the first iteration, n becomes 123.
After the second iteration, n becomes 12.
After the third iteration, n becomes 1.
After the fourth iteration, n becomes 0.
++count; increments the count variable by 1 in each iteration. 
This keeps track of how many times n can be divided by 10 before it becomes 0, which is equivalent to the number of digits in the original number.

example:

For an input of 12345:

Initial Input and Check:

n = 12345
count = 0
Since n != 0, proceed to the loop.
First Iteration:

n = 12345 / 10 = 1234
count = 1
Second Iteration:

n = 1234 / 10 = 123
count = 2
Third Iteration:

n = 123 / 10 = 12
count = 3
Fourth Iteration:

n = 12 / 10 = 1
count = 4
Fifth Iteration:

n = 1 / 10 = 0
count = 5
Loop Ends:

n = 0, so the loop ends.
The number of digits is 5.
